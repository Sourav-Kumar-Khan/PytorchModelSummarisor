# PytorchModelSummarisor
 
# Natural Language Inference: Neural Network Description Generator

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model that generates concise and coherent descriptions of PyTorch neural network models. The model will take a PyTorch neural network as input and produce a clear textual summary, explaining the input shape and output shape of the network.

## Assignment Steps

### 1. Data Generation (2 hours)
- Create a script to generate synthetic PyTorch neural network architectures
- Generate corresponding textual descriptions for each architecture
- Ensure a diverse range of network designs (various layers and configurations)
- Create input-output pairs: PyTorch model architecture (input) and textual description (output)

### 2. Model Development and Training (2 hours)
- Choose a sequence-to-sequence architecture (e.g., Transformer, LSTM with attention)
- Implement the model using PyTorch
- Prepare the data loader for the synthetic dataset
- Set up the training loop, including loss function and optimizer
- Train the model on the synthetic data
- Implement early stopping and model checkpointing

### 3. Evaluation
- Implement functions to evaluate the model's performance
- Use metrics like accuracy and F1 score
- Prepare for testing on five different PyTorch neural networks (provided by the company)

### 4. Jupyter Notebook Creation
- Create a new Jupyter notebook
- Include all code for data generation, model implementation, training, and evaluation
- Add markdown cells to explain each step of the process
- Include visualizations of training progress (if applicable)

### 5. Testing and Final Evaluation
- Load the trained model
- For each of the five provided PyTorch networks:
  * Generate a summary using the trained model
  * Compare the generated summary with the expected output
  * Calculate accuracy and F1 score
- Report the overall accuracy and F1 score for all five networks

### 6. Documentation
- Add comments to the code for clarity
- Include a brief introduction and conclusion in the notebook
- Explain any assumptions or limitations of the approach

### 7. Final Check and Submission
- Review the notebook for completeness and clarity
- Ensure all cells are executed and outputs are visible
- Double-check the inclusion of accuracy and F1 score results
- Save and submit the Jupyter notebook

## Data
- Synthetic data consisting of various neural network architectures
- Each network structure paired with a corresponding textual description
- Descriptions explain input shape and output shape

## Input
- Architecture of a neural network created in PyTorch
- Includes detailed information about layers, configurations, and parameters

## Output
A concise textual description including:
- The input shape (e.g., [b,200,10])
- The output shape (e.g., [b,10])

## Assumption
No input and output will have more than three dimensions.

## Expected Time
- Data generation: 2 hours
- Model training: 2 hours

## Submission Format
- A Jupyter notebook containing the code for the model, training, and evaluation
- Accuracy and F1 score on the given Neural networks

## Evaluation
The model will be evaluated on its ability to generate accurate and coherent summaries for five different PyTorch neural networks provided by the company after the time limit.
